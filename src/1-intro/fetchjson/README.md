## Intro to TS

### Demonstrate the value of TS

- Examples in annotations folder and index.ts throw type errors
- Writing TS is the same as JS with extra documentation
- TS has no effect on how code executes in the browser or Node
- Helps catch errors early

#### Considerations:

- Install TS `npm install -g typescript ts-node`
- Access TS compiler with `tsc` example: `tsc <filename.ts>`
- Run compile JS file `node <filename.js>`
- Join commands with ts-node: `ts-node <filename.ts>`
- fetchjson.ts demonstrates making a network request and how TS can help
- annotations/variables.ts contains examples of typing
