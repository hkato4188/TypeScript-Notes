## Arrays in TypeScript

### Definition

#### Typed Arrays: plain JS arrays where each element is some consistent type of value

#### Considerations:

- TS can do type inference when extracting values form an array
- TS can prevent us from adding incompatible values to the array
- Map, forEach, reduce functions help
- Flexible arrays can still contain multiple different types

#### When to use this knowledge:

- Any time you need to represent a collection of records
